COMPONENTS AND PROPS

Component is a piece of the website
For building our website we need to divide it into small components 

The first component is the input text and the button to make it we need to create a function and the component name must start with capital letter.In JSX either we have closing tag or self closing element

To display our component we need to insert our component inside the div variable so that react can display it on website.Two ways to display our content
 {ChatInput()}
    or
 <ChatInput /> 

 React has another way to put all together without creating an extra div called fragment <></>

 PROPS 
 every component function gets one parameter up inside the function to access the html attribute inside the react component.Props parameter is a object that contains all the attributes that we give to this component & it makes our component reusable

 To use if-statements directly inside JSX we can't use if we need guard operator(&&)
 Ex: const result = value1 && value2;
 That means if value1 is true then the result will be value2, works just like if statement

 Instead of using a variable to store our app it is best to create a component to create this app.The beat practice is to use component called app to create the website because it gives us access to extra features of components like props
